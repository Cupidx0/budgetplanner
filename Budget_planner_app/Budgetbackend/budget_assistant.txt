Hey! Based on your monthly net salary (£981.74) and bills (£1,303.49), you’re short by £321.75 every month. Here’s a focused plan:

1. Priority: Pay essentials first—Chichester College (£850), car insurance (£120), and minimum credit card payment (£120).
2. Consider pausing or reducing non-essentials like gym (£21) and car maintenance (£50).
3. Contact Chichester College and your credit card provider to discuss payment plans or hardship support.
